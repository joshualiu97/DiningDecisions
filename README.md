Dining Decisions
----------------
You're sitting in your dorm with a group of friends, and you mutually agree you're all hungry. But, no one wants to decide on which dining hall to go to! How do you break through the stalemate?

Dining Decisions is a program designed to take in the user's feelings, location, and health preferences to decide which UCLA dining hall is the best option.

To run the code, compile and run DiningDecisions.java.

A group project created by Isabel, Grace, Melody, and Joshua in 2018 at UCLA ACM Hack's HOTH V.
